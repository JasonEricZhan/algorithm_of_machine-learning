# algorithm_of_machine learning


by mostly hand code to practice understanding & develope the optimize skill application and algorithm's core idea

1.logist_reg_gradient_by_hand.py: logistic regression use gradient descent to optimize and also show the decision boundary


2.back_propagation_ann.py: artificial neuro network implement backpropagate algorithm 

( first layer is tanh , second layer is softmax)
