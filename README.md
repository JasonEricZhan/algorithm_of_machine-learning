# algorithm_of_machine learning


by mostly hand code to practice understanding & develope the optimize skill application and algorithm's core idea

Also practice to use software design though that is used to create the class 

1.logist_reg_gradient_by_hand.py: logistic regression use gradient descent to optimize and also show the decision boundary

*can get top 29% in  kaggle titanic data set tutorial by only using this hand code class to predict 


2.back_propagation_ann.py: artificial neural network implement backpropagate algorithm 

*first layer is tanh , second layer is softmax
